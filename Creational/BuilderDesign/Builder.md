Here’s the **ultimate cheat sheet** for the **Builder Design Pattern** — everything you need to know:
✅ **Character**, ✅ **When to Use**, and ❌ **When NOT to Use**.

## 🧱 CHARACTERISTICS of Builder Pattern

| Feature                                          | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Step-by-step construction**                  | Build objects in multiple chained steps (e.g. `.setX().setY().build()`) |
| ✅ **Immutable result**                           | Final object is often immutable (fields declared `final`)               |
| ✅ **Readable & Fluent**                          | Code reads naturally: `new Car.Builder("Model", "Engine").gps(true)...` |
| ✅ **Handles optional parameters**                | Great when some object fields are optional or defaulted                 |
| ✅ **Separates construction from representation** | Builder encapsulates construction logic                                 |
| ✅ **Nested static builder class**                | Common structure in Java, especially for POJOs/DTOs                     |
| ✅ **No telescoping constructors**                | Avoids tons of constructor overloads (`new Car(..., ..., ..., ...)`)    |

## ✅ WHEN TO USE the Builder Pattern

Use it when you have:

| Scenario                                    | Why Builder is ideal                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Too many constructor parameters           | Especially if some are optional/default   |
| ✅ Complex object creation logic             | Eg. conditionally adding pieces to object |
| ✅ Immutable objects                         | You can initialize all fields only once   |
| ✅ Fluent, readable object creation          | Improves clarity and chaining             |
| ✅ Need for object validation while building | Add validation logic in `build()` method  |
| ✅ Library-style APIs                        | Makes your API clean and user-friendly    |

### 🚗 Example: Car, Computer, Meal, HttpRequest, JSON Builders

```java
new Car.Builder("Tesla", "EV").sunroof(true).gps(true).build();
```

## ❌ WHEN *NOT* TO USE the Builder Pattern

Avoid Builder Pattern when:

| Scenario                                       | Better Alternative                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Simple objects with few fields               | Just use a constructor or setters         |
| ❌ Object needs frequent changes after creation | Use a mutable class instead               |
| ❌ You want high performance / low memory       | Builder creates extra object for building |
| ❌ You're creating dozens of objects fast       | Builder adds overhead, better use POJOs   |
| ❌ You use frameworks like Hibernate or Jackson | They often require a no-arg constructor   |
| ❌ You need serialization                       | Builders and final fields can be tricky   |

---

## ✅ Builder Pattern is **NOT Good When**:

* You’re just initializing 2-3 fields → **constructor is simpler**
* The object needs to be **mutated repeatedly** → Use **setters**
* You’re creating many objects **in a loop** → Builder adds overhead

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Should You Use It? | If...                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Yes              | You have many optional fields           |
| ✅ Yes              | You want immutability + clarity         |
| ❌ No               | You just need to set 2–3 fields         |
| ❌ No               | You need fast, repeated object creation |

### Builder Design Pattern Code Walkthrough

### Summary

+ When you want to create an object, but if the objects takes in too many configuration, then you would end up creating a big ugly ass constructor, too many overloaded constructors. 
+ Also you are forcing the client to send infor of all the parameters even if they are not intrested. 
+ Using builder design pattern, each of config would be a setter method which the client can invoke to taste. 
+ The builder will linearly build the object in chained fashsion and produces the product, you cant access the product class, its untouchable or immutable.
